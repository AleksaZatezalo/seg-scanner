# Seg Scanner
Seg Scanner is a python package made to help with segmentation scanning during network security assessments. It scans a list of ports in an IP range and returns a list of open ports.

## A Deep Dive into Seg Scanner
Seg-scanner (short for segmentation scanner) checks to make sure that a computer in one subnet cannot reach a computer in another. Many cyber security compliacne criteria require that network segementation be put in place. For example PCI DSS requires that systems which stores, processes or transmit credit card data are isolated from those that do not. Segmentation scanning confirms that a computer on a certain subnet cannot reach another by attempting to connect to all ports of the corresponding subnet. If no ports are accessible the network can be seen as properly segmented. This seg scanner can be used in the flowing scenarios:
- Compliance tests
- Ethical hacking & Red Teaming
- Confirming Security Policy Implementation
- Confirming that Zero Trust has been correctly implemented
- Confirming that micro-segmentation has been correctly implemented
