## What is Segmentation Scanning? (One Paragraph)
Many cyber security compliacne criteria require that network segementation be put in place. For example PCI DSS requires that systems which stores, processes or transmit credit card data are isolated from those that do not. Segmentation scanning confirms that a certain subnet cannot reach another by attempting to connect to all ports of the corresponding subnet.
